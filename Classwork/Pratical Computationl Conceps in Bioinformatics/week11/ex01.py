#Answer to question one from the homework

BeautifulSoup is an HTML/XML parser which was recommended to me by a friend. I was intereted in getting involved with a bit of web scraping for fun and he highly recommended this one to me. I checked it out and actually loved it. While I haven't had the time to implement it in any scripts just yet I've got a few ideas. I was thinking about monitoring rates and locations of specific wikipedia edits as a function of this upcoming presidental election. It'd be interested to see if there are any particular 'hotspots' or patterns which could be found.
Actually, another friend of mine who I showed this to developed a script which checked the daily show's site at random throughout the day for tickets to his final show and it actually worked. 
Anyway, I think it's a fantastically designed library which can save any user a whole bunch of time sorting through html or xml. I'd recommend checkign it out. The most recent version is Beautifulsoup4 however I have only been exposed to beautifulsoup3.
