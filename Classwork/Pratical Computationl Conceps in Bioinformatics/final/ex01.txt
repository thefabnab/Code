Final assignment question No. 1

a. How much disck space your own home area is using?

$du -h /home/nazamy1/
this prints out a display of the contents of a folder and their size. Using the -h tag you can have a human readable output. ~ 700MB for my folder.


b. How many files are in your entire home area?

$find nazamy1/ -print | wc -l
The find program searches and displays recursively all the files within a directory (including other directories within it) with the | redirecting STDOUT to count the number of lines provided by the find results. There are 75 files within my home directory, including the home folder itself.

c. What permissions would you set on your home area to make sure no one else could even look into it to see what files are there?

There are three classes of permission sets available on Unix for users. There's user, group, and global per missions each with 3 distinct accessibility options: read, write, and execute. If I wanted to prevent other users (anyone not me) from viewing the contents of my folder I would set up my permissions as follows:
-rwx------
Using the following octal command:
chmod 700 /home/nazamy1/ 
Each of the digits in places in the chmod flag 700 is reflective of a user permission level; myself (7), group members (0), and others (0). The numbers dictate what level of permissions I am granting them with 0 being none and 7 being all and numbers 1-6 providing various limited access.

d. Determine which shell you are currently using?

ps -p $$

Under the CMD column should be listed the shell type currently being in use

e. Read the last 10 lines of a file called foo and write them to a new file called bar

tail -n 10 foo  > bar
