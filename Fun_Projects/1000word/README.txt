The idea behind the 1000 word project is to analyze the speech patterns pertaining to modern political rhetoric. 
This was spawned from an xkcd post (https://xkcd.com/1133/) which attempted to describe everyday objects using only the top 1000 words used within the english language.
Something I noted was the explicit lack of ability to describe places and things using only those words and was curious if this could be applied to human language as a method of determining discriptive intent. A sort of BS meter quantifying those polticians wishing to say more but communicate less.
Anyway, politicians could be compared to one another,other professionals, or even normal speaking patterns across the states.
